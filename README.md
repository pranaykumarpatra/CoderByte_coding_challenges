# CoderByte_coding_challenges
Solution of the questions that I faced on coderByte.[JAVA]


#Question number :-1
------------------------
Have the function ClosestEnemy(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and from the position in the array where a 1 is, return the number of spaces either left or right you must move to reach an enemy which is represented by a 2. For example: if arr is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2] then your program should return 3 because the closest enemy (2) is 3 spaces away from the 1. The array will contain any number of 0's and 2's, but only a single 1. It may not contain any 2's at all as well, where in that case your program should return a 0.

Solution:- closestEnemey.java


"// For this challenge you will search in an array for an enemy.

#Question number:- 2
----------------------
Have the function StringChallenge(str) take the str parameter being passed which will be an average rating between 0.00 and 5.00 , and convert this rating into a list of 5 image names to be displayed in a user interface to represent the rating as a list of stars and half stars. Rating should be rounded to the nearest half. There are 3 image names availabe : "full.jpg","half.jpg","empty.jpg". The output will be the name of 5 images (without extension), from left to right, separated by spaces. For example : if "str" is "2.36" then this should be displayed by the following: "full full half empty empty".

input: "0.38"
output : half empty empty empty empty


input : "4.5"
output: full full full full half
